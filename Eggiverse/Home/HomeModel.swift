        EggFactModel(title: "Protective Cuticle", desc: "The eggshell is covered with a cuticle, a thin film that protects against the penetration of bacteria.", imageName: "mockFact3"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Egg Composition", desc: "The weight of a chicken egg is about 10% on the shell, 60% on the protein and 30% on the yolk.", imageName: "mockFact"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Shell Color", desc: "The color of the shell (white, cream, brown, bluish) depends only on the breed of the bird, and not on the nutritional value.", imageName: "mockFact2"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Protein Content", desc: "Egg white consists of 90% water and 10% proteins (albumin, ovotransferrin, etc.).", imageName: "mockFact3"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Fat in Yolk", desc: "There is practically no fat in the protein, and the yolk contains up to 6 grams of fat.", imageName: "mockFact"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Choline Rich", desc: "The yolk is rich in choline, a substance necessary for the functioning of the brain and nervous system.", imageName: "mockFact2"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Complete Protein", desc: "The egg contains all the essential amino acids, so the protein is considered a reference.", imageName: "mockFact3"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Yolk Color", desc: "The color of the yolk depends on the nutrition of the chicken: the more carotenoids in the feed (for example, corn, carrots, greens), the brighter it is.", imageName: "mockFact"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Protein Denaturation", desc: "When heated, the protein collapses — this is the process of protein denaturation, due to which the egg becomes hard.", imageName: "mockFact2"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Natural Emulsifier", desc: "Protein is an excellent emulsifier: it allows you to mix immiscible liquids (for example, oil and water in mayonnaise).", imageName: "mockFact3"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Whipped Foam", desc: "The whipped protein forms a foam, trapping air bubbles, which is used in meringue and souffle.", imageName: "mockFact"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Natural Thickener", desc: "Eggs can be a natural thickener for sauces and creams.", imageName: "mockFact2"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Baking Powder", desc: "In cooking, eggs are used as a baking powder — whipped whites make baking easier.", imageName: "mockFact3"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Air Chamber Growth", desc: "With age, the egg's air chamber increases: the more the egg floats in the water, the older it gets.", imageName: "mockFact"),
        EggFactModel(title: "White Density", desc: "The white of a fresh egg is dense and holds its shape, while that of an old one is liquid and spreads.", imageName: "mockFact2"),
        EggFactModel(title: "Shell Peeling", desc: "A fresh egg is difficult to peel off the shell after cooking, while an old one is easy to clean.", imageName: "mockFact3"),
